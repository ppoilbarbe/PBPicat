# Changelog

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-03

Initial release.

### Features

- **Rename schema** — N configurable text fields (6 by default) that build both the destination directory tree and the filename prefix. One optional numeric counter field (`###`) auto-increments from the existing maximum, with separate counters for images and videos.
- **Sidecar support** — sidecar files (`.xmp`, `.dop`, `.pp3`, …) are renamed alongside their parent file automatically. Extensions are configurable and support multiple dots.
- **Video marker** — optional text marker inserted at a configurable position in the filename to distinguish video files from images.
- **File panel** — directory tree on the left, file list on the right with async thumbnails, sidecar indicators, and hover preview of the resulting filename.
- **Sidecar content filter** — filter the file list by a Python regex matched against sidecar file contents; only files with at least one matching sidecar are shown.
- **Context menu** — right-click a file to infer schema fields from its name (*Template*) or permanently delete it and its sidecars (*Delete*).
- **Multi-level undo** — click *Undo last rename* repeatedly to reverse successive rename operations one by one.
- **Catalog system** — named configuration profiles, each with independent settings, field histories, and window state. The `default` catalog always exists and cannot be deleted.
- **Image viewer** — double-click a thumbnail to open a zoomable viewer; it stays open and follows selection after rename or delete.
- **Internationalisation** — English and French interface; language selectable in Preferences (restart required).
- **Standalone executables** — pre-built binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows via PyInstaller; no Python installation required.
